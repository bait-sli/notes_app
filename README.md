## What is Note ?

Note is a small full stack web application that allows you to create and manage your notes. i built this application as a technical review for an opened full stack position.

## What is the stack ?

The application is built with the following technologies:

- Next.js/React
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Python/FastAPI
- SQLite

## What is the purpose of the application ?

The purpose of the application is to allow you to create and manage your notes. The application is built with the following features:

- Create a new note
- Edit a note
- Delete a note
- View the history of a note

## How to run the application ?

The application has two parts, the frontend and the backend. The frontend is a Next.js application and the backend is a Python FastAPI application. To run the application, you need to have both the frontend and the backend running.

All instructions to run the frontend and the backend are provided in the README file in their respective folders.

## Why this stack ?

Even not being a senior Python developer for backend part, I chose to use Python/FastAPI because I wanted to learn how to use it and challenge myself. I hope the result is as good as you expected it to be.

Concerning the database, for this case, i chose SQLite for it's simplicity and ease of use. Since you don't have to run a dedicated database server, also the database can directly be stored in the application folder itself.

For the frontend, i chose Next.js since it's actually one of the best frameworks for building frontend applications and of course it's based on React.

To handle UI interactions, i chose Tailwind CSS since it's a very popular framework and come natively with Next.js.

## What can be the improvements ?

I'm sure there are many things that can be improved in this application. Some of them are:

- Adding tests on both the frontend and the backend
- Adding an atomic approach to the frontend and breaking the application into more smaller components
- Adding a user authentication system
- Adding a user profile system
- Adding a search system
- Adding a note sharing system
- Adding an AI assistant to the note editor
- Adding WYSIWYG editor instead of the simple textarea
